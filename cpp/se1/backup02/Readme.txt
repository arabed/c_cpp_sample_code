Assignment:	[se1] Simple Language Interpreter 
----------


Description:	
-----------
Observing Linux Behavior by extracting information about Linux Kernel 
through /proc and /usr system files.
My assignment solution consists of the following files:
- observer_b.cc
- observer_c.cc
- observer_d.cc
- observer_b.exe
- observer_c.exe
- observer_d.exe
- Makefile_b
- Makefile_c
- Makefile_d


Running my solution:
-------------------
You can run my assignment as follows:

	cd dir_with_my_files
	observer_b.exe


IDE/Compiler:	
------------
Dev-C++(Open Source IDE)/gcc and g++ compatible


Running procedure:
-----------------


Assumptions:
-----------
The observer programs are been designed, implemented and tested on 
Linux (SUSE with Linux Kernel version 2.6.5-7.202.7).
These programs will terminated with error upon running on any 
Windows systems and might malfunction in other cases.


Conclusions/Remarks:
-------------------
Some of the Linux Kernel information could be found in multiple locations
the way of using a particular file in this assignment doesn't suggest that
other locations are not valid.

There are a lot of considerations been put in design and implementation of this project to make it flexible and extesible. Hopefully this will create a good basis for future projects. However delibertly this expantion facilites kept to minimume to not jeopertize the current requirements late or low quality delivery.



Errors/Bugs:
-----------
One error I can not fix/find is ...
There might be a bug in function ... You can see it by running the
program with the following parameters ...
